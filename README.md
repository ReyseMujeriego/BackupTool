## EasySave üöÄ

Our team has recently joined the software publisher **ProSoft**. Under the responsibility of the **CIO**, we are tasked with managing the **EasySave** project, which involves developing backup software.  

As with all software in the **ProSoft Suite**, this software will be integrated into the company's pricing policy.  

- **Unit Price**: ‚Ç¨200 excl. VAT üí∂  
- **Annual Maintenance Contract (5 days/week, 8 AM - 5 PM, including updates)**: 12% of the purchase price (annual contract with tacit renewal and price adjustments based on the **SYNTEC index**).

## Built With üõ†Ô∏è

- [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/fr/vs/)  
- [GitHub](https://github.com/)  
- [Draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/)

## Features üåü

### **Version 1** üìú

The software is a **console application** developed using **.NET Core**. It supports the creation of up to **five backup jobs**.  

A job is defined by:  

- **Name** üè∑Ô∏è  
- **Source folder path** üóÇÔ∏è  
- **Target folder path** üìÅ  
- **Backup type**: Complete or Differential üîÑ  

Once the user creates the jobs, they can execute them **individually** or **simultaneously**. The source and target paths can be located on **local, external, or network drives**.  

When backups are executed, the software must generate **two files**:

#### **Daily Log üìÖ**  

- Timestamp ‚è∞  
- Backup name üìù  
- Full source file path üõ£Ô∏è  
- Full destination file path üè†  
- File size üìè  
- File transfer time (in milliseconds) ‚è≥  

#### **Real-time Status üîÑ**  

- Backup type üóÇÔ∏è  
- Timestamp of the last action ‚è±Ô∏è  
- Backup job status (**Active, Inactive, etc.**) üö¶  

If the job is active:  
- Total number of eligible files üìÇ  
- Size of files to be transferred üíæ  
- Progress:  
  - Number of remaining files üìù  
  - Size of remaining files üìä  
  - Full source file path being backed up üîí  
  - Full destination file path üîë  

---

### **Version 2** üîß

#### **Graphical Interface üñ•Ô∏è**
- The console mode is abandoned. The application must now be graphical and based on WPF or a framework of your choice (e.g., Avalonia).

#### **Unlimited Number of Jobs ‚ôæÔ∏è**
- The number of backup jobs is now unlimited.

#### **Encryption via CryptoSoft üîê**
- The software must be able to encrypt files using CryptoSoft (developed during Project 4). Only files with extensions defined by the user in the general settings will be encrypted.

#### **Evolution of the Daily Log File üìà**
- The daily log file must include an additional piece of information:
  - Time required for file encryption (in ms)
    - `0`: no encryption üö´
    - `>0`: encryption time (in ms) ‚è≥
    - `<0`: error code ‚ùå

#### **Business Software üíº**
- If a business software is detected, the software must prevent the launch of a backup job. For sequential jobs, the software must finish backing up the current file.
- The user can define the business software in the general settings of the software. (Note: the calculator application can substitute for business software during demonstrations.)
- The stop must be logged in the log file üìù.

---

### **Version 3** üöÄ

#### **Parallel Backup ‚ö°**
- Backup tasks are now executed in parallel, replacing the previous sequential mode.  

#### **Priority File Management üìÇ**
- Non-priority files cannot be backed up while priority extensions are still pending.  
- The priority extensions are predefined by the user in the general settings.  

#### **Large File Transfer Restrictions üö´**
- To prevent network congestion, transferring two large files simultaneously is prohibited.  
- Threshold (n KB) is configurable.  
- ‚úÖ While transferring a large file, other tasks can transfer smaller files** (as long as they comply with the priority rule).  

#### **Real-Time Task Interaction üéõÔ∏è** 
Users can interact with each backup task or all tasks at once:  
‚úÖ Pause ‚Üí Effective after the current file transfer.  
‚ñ∂Ô∏è Play ‚Üí Start or resume a paused task.  
‚õî Stop ‚Üí Immediately halt the task and its ongoing transfer.  
üìä Live Progress Tracking ‚Üí Display progress percentage in real time.  

#### **Auto-Pause for Business Applications ‚è∏Ô∏è** 
- If a business software is detected running, all backup tasks will automatically pause.  
- Tasks resume automatically when the business software is closed.  
- Example: If the Calculator app is running, all backups must pause.  

#### **Remote Monitoring Console üåê**   
- A graphical **remote interface (UI)** to monitor and manage backup tasks in real time.  
- Minimum requirements:  
  - üñ•Ô∏è Graphical Interface 
  - üì° Communication via Sockets 

#### **Single-Instance Enforcement for CryptoSoft üîí**
- CryptoSoft must run as a single instance.  
- It cannot be executed multiple times on the same machine.  
- Necessary modifications ensure proper single-instance management.  

#### **Adaptive Parallelism Based on Network Load (Optional) üìâ**
- If network load exceeds a set **threshold**, the application will reduce parallel tasks to prevent saturation.
